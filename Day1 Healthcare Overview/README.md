🏥 Cybersecurity in Healthcare: A Growing Concern

This project explores the growing threat of cybersecurity breaches in the healthcare industry. It includes real-world examples, visual summaries, and insights gained during my learning journey.

📌 Overview

- Understand why healthcare is a top target for cyberattacks
- Analyze ransomware trends and the impact on hospitals
- Identify gaps in HIPAA cybersecurity enforcement
- Explore the role of third-party vendors in breaches
- Learn from case studies like the University of Vermont Medical Center and Change Healthcare

🔍 Key Topics Covered

| Topic                          | Key Insight |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| Ransomware Epidemic           | Healthcare adopts tech fast, but lacks security |
| HIPAA Limitations             | Weak enforcement, reactive not proactive        |
| Vendor Vulnerabilities        | One breach affects many hospitals               |
| Operational Impacts           | Recovery is slow, patient care disrupted        |
| Call for Mandatory Standards  | Need stronger regulations & enforcement         |

📈 What I Learned

- Hospitals are highly vulnerable due to reliance on outdated systems and third-party vendors.
- Cyberattacks are not just IT problems — they affect patient lives.
- Regulatory updates and technical defense mechanisms are both urgently needed.

🔧 Tools I’ll Use in Future Modules

- Wireshark for traffic analysis
- Nmap for network scanning
- Splunk for log analysis and alerts
